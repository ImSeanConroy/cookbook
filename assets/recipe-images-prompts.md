# Prompts

This project uses AI-generated images for all recipe photography.

As a software engineer and amateur cook — not a professional photographer — I designed these prompts to create consistent, high-quality food imagery suitable for a modern recipe website. The goal is to achieve a clean, natural, editorial food magazine style inspired by services like HelloFresh, while maintaining realism and appetizing presentation.

## Plate

A high-quality, professional food photograph of [recipe] styled for a modern recipe website. The dish is plated beautifully on a ceramic plate with natural, fresh ingredients visible. Shot in landscape orientation from a 45-degree angle (three-quarter angle), slightly above the table. Bright, natural daylight lighting with soft shadows. Clean, minimal styling inspired by HelloFresh food photography. Vibrant but natural colors, crisp texture details, realistic food appearance. Placed on a light wooden or neutral stone background with subtle kitchen props (linen napkin, cutlery, small bowls of ingredients). Shallow depth of field, DSLR quality, ultra sharp focus, editorial food magazine style, 16:9 aspect ratio, no text, no watermark.

## Bowl

A high-quality, professional food photograph of [recipe] styled for a modern recipe website. The dish is beautifully served in a ceramic bowl, with fresh, natural ingredients visibly layered and thoughtfully arranged on top. Shot in landscape orientation from a 45-degree (three-quarter) angle, slightly above the table. Bright, natural daylight with soft, diffused shadows. Clean, minimal styling inspired by HelloFresh food photography. Vibrant yet natural colors, crisp texture details, realistic steam and moisture where appropriate. Set on a light wooden or neutral stone surface with subtle kitchen props such as a folded linen napkin, chopsticks or spoon, and small ingredient bowls nearby. Shallow depth of field, DSLR quality, ultra-sharp focus, editorial food magazine style, 16:9 aspect ratio, no text, no watermark.

## Bread

The bread is artfully presented on a rustic wooden chopping board, showcasing its crust texture and interior crumb (slightly sliced if appropriate). Shot in landscape orientation from a 45-degree (three-quarter) angle, slightly above the table. Bright, natural daylight with soft shadows enhancing texture and depth. Clean, minimal styling inspired by HelloFresh food photography. Vibrant yet natural colors, crisp detail, realistic texture. Set on a light wooden or neutral stone background with subtle kitchen props such as a linen napkin, bread knife, scattered flour, or small bowls of complementary ingredients. Shallow depth of field, DSLR quality, ultra-sharp focus, editorial food magazine style, 16:9 aspect ratio, no text, no watermark.
